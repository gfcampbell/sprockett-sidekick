// script.js
// Main application script for Oblivn private video chat

// All functionality from this file has been moved to ui.js and connection.js
// for better organization and to eliminate duplicate code.
// 
// This file is kept for backward compatibility but contains no active code.
// 
// The config.js file is the source of truth for:
// - Global configuration variables (iceServers)
// - Application state object (state)
// - DOM element references
//
// Main functionality is now divided between:
// - ui.js: UI interactions, media controls, and device management
// - connection.js: WebRTC connections, signaling, and peer communication
