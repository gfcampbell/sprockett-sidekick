- Enterprise adoption rate

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Current (MVP)
```
[Mic Input] + [System Audio] → [Electron App] → [Node.js Server] → [OpenAI APIs] → [UI Display]
```

### Future (Full Vision)
```
[Multiple Audio Sources] → [Capture Layer] → [Diarization] → [Context Engine] ← [Vector DB]
                                                                      ↓
                                                               [LLM Processing]
                                                                      ↓
                                                     [Multi-Modal Output Layer]
```

## Development Priorities

1. **Immediate (MVP)**
   - Basic audio capture and transcription
   - Simple UI with start/stop functionality
   - Core AI coaching features
   - Local operation only

2. **Next Quarter**
